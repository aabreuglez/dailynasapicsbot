## Daily Nasa Pics

Every single day NASA publishes a photo through it's open api. 
Since I really like almost everyone of then and I share them with my friends every day 
I decided to create this bot.

It justs download a JSON through the api once per day (using a cron like for node), and
then sends: The title, the normal pic as photo and the hd pic as document to a telegram channel.


## Usage

If you wanna host yours, just download it, modify the config.js in config folder with
the required parameters and enjoy!
