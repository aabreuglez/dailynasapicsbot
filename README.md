## Daily Nasa Pics

Every day NASA publishes a photo through its open api. 
Since I really like those images and I usually share them with my friends I decided to create this bot.

It justs download a JSON through the api once per day (using cron on openshift), and
then sends: The title, the normal pic as photo and the hd pic as a document to a telegram channel.
